# ROSA: R Optimization with Static Analysis
This is an intial version of the ROSA package. This package is being released primarily to gather input from the wider community and to seek collaborators to help with further development of the initial ideas published in our preliminary paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02996. Volunteers to help make this code production ready is especially welcome.

## Warning: This package reflects the current state of ROSA, and it has a number of rough edges. 
The authors acknowledge that help from the core R developer community is needed to help ROSA see the light of the day, and we look forward to hearing from you if you are interested in these ideas.
